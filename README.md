The scope is to visualize number of direct trains running daily between given cities in Poland using:

1. [https://rozklad-pkp.pl](https://rozklad-pkp.pl/) - web Polish Railways timetable,
2. list of cities (see file [cities.csv](cities.csv))
3. Selenium library for browsing timetable
4. Pandas for preparing output
5. Seaborn, Plotly, Geopy libraries for visualization

## Processing of the data

Script [PKP_SCRAP.py](PKP_SCRAP.py) uses Selenium as a main tool for timetable browsing. It checks if direct connection between cities exists (from the file [cities.csv](cities.csv)). If so, it counted the number and store the value. Finally output data (`graf.csv`) is saved and ready to be visualized. 

The list of cities in `cities.csv` is configurable â€“ you can provide city names you are interested in.

## Visualization

Visualization is done by [PKP_graf.py](PKP_graf.py). It creates pivot table for Seaborn heatmap, generates it and saves as a `heat.jpg` file. It also geocodes names to Lat, Lon, and using Plotly plot on the map cities and a graph of direct trains connections - opens as a html page

Running the tool you can easily visualize and understand train traffic volume in terms of number of trains (not passengers).

## Usage:

1. Input city names in `cities.csv`
2. Run [PKP_SCRAP.py](RUN_SCRAP.py)
3. Run [PKP_graf.py](RUN_graf.py)
